<p> When I start this journal, I wanted to thanks my parent who give me the chance to come to Canada, I know this has always been your dream since you're very young, but unfortunately you didn't get the chance when you're young and you had to wait until all the hard work over the years to be able to come to Canada.  I grateful for that you let me come, you will never be able to guess how happy I was when you say we're coming to canada. I don't when will you be able to read it, maybe you wouldn't be able to read it at all, it all depends if we have that luck. </p>

<p> Anyways, I moved 3 schools in 3 years, don't get me wrong I move because my house is rent and whenever the rent is due we had to move to a different places. I guess this three years had been very hard because we keep moving. This year is different, we brought house in Laurelwood, and that mean we can stay here until I go to university. Everyone in Laurelwood is nice and of course today I'm going to write some important events that had happen this year. My letter to Gr.7 me:</p>

<p> Do you still remember what happen in Gr.6? Because of the coronavirus (covid-19), the school had been stop. I'm writing this letter to Kate in Gr.7 because I think there is something that is memorable for the Gr.7 you to remember.  </p>

<p> Time speed by very fast, no one can every imagine how fast time flew by. It is unbelivable fast. Do you remember what you learn in the Gr.6 summer? You promise yourself that you will try your best on everything you got, I know it sound a little bit greedy, but try your best on everything you got. Be precious on every chance you got.</p>

<p> I guess is kind of weird writting a letter to myself like this, but I just wanted to tell you never forget our intention. Be the Kate you wanted to be. Always believe in yourself. Don't ever forget the amazing time we had in Gr.6, see you next year Kate. </p>
